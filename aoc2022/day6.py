Day 6 - Tuning Trouble

Another simple task if you know how to implement the key component: sliding windows.
This is a good use for Python's *generators*, since we can build a helper just for
iterating over the items seen by the sliding window. From there on it is enough to
solve the task ("are all items unique?") for one window and combine the two.

Note that while the sliding window helper is convenient, it is overkill for this.
Since we only ever look at a window of about a dozen items, creating and discarding
a string slice for each window would be more efficient. A sliding window generator
is useful especially when the input is streamed, e.g. it is too large for memory.
